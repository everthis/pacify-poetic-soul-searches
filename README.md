# pacify-poetic-soul-searches / the pacified soul.

```
If you can't deal with your negativity, at least avoid
drowning others into it.
```

```
When you are angry, be silent.
```

```
Never Apologize
Never Explain
```

```
The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
```

```
Go to the people and the places that set a spark in your soul.
```

```
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says "I'm possible".
```

```
The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
```

```
She is air, I am the fire.
```

```
As you wish.
```

```
If you are never alone, you cannot know yourself.
```

```
You make me want to be a better man.
```


```
When I miss you, I re-read our old messages and smile
like an idiot.
```

```
I had so many chances I blew cause I was too damn shy.
```

```
Never mistake motion for action.
```

```
Lol, today you said hi to me and I died.
```

```
Biggest regret of my life - to fight with the ones who loved me.
```

```
I am jealous of every star near you, because I'm not one of them.
```

```
Love not if you fear, fear not if you love.
```

```
I can't seem to calm down
Because I need you here now
No, I can't put my phone down
Hoping that you call now
Scrolling through our pictures
I'm closer to you
```

```
I dial the number but hanged it down.
Being alone for long was making me down.
I close my eyes and ride back to the dark,
where I found you and together we sparked.
```

```
Someday when the pages of my life end, I know that you
will be one of the most beautiful chapters.
```

```
Take her under the moonlight and let her speak her heart out.
```

```
Life is like an ice cream, taste its flavour before it melts away.
```

```
The responsibility of love: to keep another's heart safe.
```

```
When it is all finished, you'll discover it was never random.
```

```
She is rare, so love her right.
```

```
Kiss her and label her as yours.
```

```
You or none.
```

```
Love her too much.
```

```
Future lies in our hands, make it or break it.
```

```
Miracles happen when she's around me.
```

```
I don't want to be friends, I want all of you.
```

```
I smiled, we were under the same sky at least.
```

```
Her heart is a fragile glass, if it breaks
the broken pieces will hurt you too.
```

```
She is a storm worth facing and surviving.
```

```
The one who cares is the one who loves.
```

```
She was looking for someone who could stay by her side
not for the one who goes crazy at her beauty.
```

```
Never give up on love if you feel it's worth waiting.
```

```
Choose the one who choose you before anything and everything.
```

```
Sometimes love dies without warning.
```

```
Express your love, we can't read minds.
```

```
Distance means so little when someone means so much.
```

```
I love people who gossip behind my back. That's exactly
where they belong. Behind my back.
```

```
People are not swings, you can't keep pushing them away
and expecting them to come back.
```

```
It is both a blessing and a curse to feel everything so
very deeply.
```

```
As long as we don't die, this is gonna be one hell of a story.
```

```
I love you, I thought. But I didn't say it.
```

```
Love isn't about perfection, it's about being fearless.
```

```
Even though we never said it to each other, we knew. 
```

```
In love we become little more kind.
```

```
The one you love always looks prettiest of all.
```

```
Look inside to know a person, everything out is just an illusion.
```

```
Beautiful things don't ask for attention.
```

```
I asked God, "Why are you taking me through troubled water?". He
replied, "Because your enemies can't swim."
```

```
The very essence of romance is uncertainty.
```

```
Maybe it's the best ending.
```
