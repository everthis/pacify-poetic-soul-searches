```
If you can't deal with your negativity, at least avoid
drowning others into it.
```

```
Stay kind.
```

```
Be the love
you never received.
```

```
Her silence, filled oceans,
and I drowned in, with tears.
```

```
It breaks my heart to ask
why did you bring us so far
if we were destined to fall apart. 
```

```
People who make it look easy are often working the hardest.
```

```
You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep
because reality is finally better than your dreams.
```

```
She wore a smile with heavenly grace,
and the prettiest eyes of human race.
```

```
"I don't know what's gonna happen in the future.
All I know is right here, right now, I want to spend every moment I can with you.
You're the first thing I want to see when I wake up and the last thing"
I love you.
Forever.
```

```
Only dead fish go with the flow.
```

```
Be yourself, everyone else is already taken.
```

```
Sometimes you expect a lot from someone because you'd do that much for them.
```

```
Every next level of your life will demand a different you.
```

```
How aware are you of your traumas and suppressed emotions
and how you are actively working to heal them
before you try to project that shit on me?
```

```
Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.
```

```
I found you without looking, and love you without trying.
```

```
Most people just want to be in the result and not in the process,
and it's in the process where you realize who deserves to be in the result.
```

```
When you are angry, be silent.
```

```
Never explain yourself.
Your friends don't need it and your enemies won't believe it.
```

```
I am the end or the beginning.
```

```
No amount of guilt can change the past,
and no amount of anxiety can change the future.
```

```
The best revenge is not to be like that.
```

```
The most beautiful art is looking into someone's eyes,
when they talk about the things they love.
```

```
Empathy without boundaries is self-destruction.
```

```
Are You Really Happy Or Just Comfortable?
```

```
Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost.
```

```
Demand evidence and think critically.
```

```
Your silence gives consent.
```

```
Even those we love the most can be a poison to our souls.
```

```
For there is never anything but the present,
and if one cannot live there, one cannot live anywhere.
```

```
I’ve had a lot of worries in my life,
most of which never happened.
```

```
It takes very little to govern good people. Very little.
And bad people can't be governed at all.
Or if they could I never heard of it.
```

```
You're under no obligation to be the same person you were 5 minutes ago.
```

```
Sometimes, magic is just someone spending more time on something
than anyone else might reasonably expect.
```

```
Your opinion is not my reality. 
```

```
Reclaim your mind and get it out of the hands of the cultural engineers who
want to turn you into a half-baked moron consuming all this trash that's being
manufactured out of the bones of a dying world.
```

```
Your problem is that you equate your purpose with goal-based achievement.
The universe isn't interested in your achievements, just your heart.
```

```
I'm in an uncomfortable stage of my life
where my old self is gone but my new self isn't fully born yet.
I'm in midst of transformation.
```

```
One day, in retrospect, the years of struggle
will strike you as the most beautiful.
```

```
The real gateway drug is trauma, read that again.
```

```
I grew up undervaluing solitude.
As an only child with immigrant parents who were struggling to make ends meet,
I was my own constant companion.
```

```
Sometimes you win,
sometimes you learn.
```

```
I had to make you uncomfortable, otherwise you never would have moved.
```

```
I like the kind of people who get excited
over the stars at night.
```

```
Your best teacher is your last mistake.
```

```
Wrong is wrong even if everyone is doing it,
right is right even if no one is doing it.
```

```
I found the key to happiness, stay away from idiots.
```

```
When you talk, you are only repeating what you already know.
But if you listen, you may learn something new.
```

```
Her lips tasted honey.
I kissed her, 
And took a journey from lips to waist.
Biting her neck,
Kissing her shoulders.
Digging my face into her chest.
```

```

It's the small habits.
How you spend your mornings.
How you talk to yourself.
What you read, watch and listen to. 
Who you share your energy with.
Who have access to you.
That will change your life.
```

```
Your shitty childhood isn’t an excuse to be a shitty person.
Your shitty luck with relationships isn’t an excuse to be a shitty person.
Your shitty experiences aren’t an excuse to be a shitty person.
We all have our shit, and you can either let it define you, or you grow from it.
```

```
Getting angry with people for making mistakes
doesn't teach them not to make mistakes,
it just teaches them to hide them.
```

```
Too many people think the grass is greener somewhere else
but grass is green where you water it.
Remember that.
```

```
Working on yourself is not selfish.
```

```
You often feel tired,
not because you've done too much,
but because you've done too little of what sparks a light in you.
```

```
Step over ants.
Put worms back in the grass.
Rescue baby caterpillars.
Release spiders back into your garden.
Open windows for bees to fly home.
They are all little souls that deserve a life too.
```

```
Remove expectations from people,
and you'll remove their power to hurt your feelings.
If you don't like something,
just take away it's only power: your attention.
```

```
Don’t use social media less. Use it more intentionally.
Follow people who inspire and motivate you.
Engage with experts you can learn from.
Create genuine, positive friendships. 
Just stop mindlessly scrolling, complaining, hating
and engaging in negativity and bitterness.
```

```
Never judge someone by the opinion of others.
```

```
The one I will become will catch me.
```

```
Let’s be real for a second: swear words are just words.
And what makes them offensive or inoffensive is entirely arbitrary.
```

```
If you don't heal what hurt you,
you will bleed on people who didn't cut you.
```

```
This is hard. You've done hard things before and I believe in you.
```

```
I have more conversations
in my head than I do in real life.
```

```
Start seeing everything as God, But keep it a secret.
```

```
Never Apologize
Never Explain
Never Stop
```

```
Give yourself time.
```

```
The ocean does not apologize for its depth
and the mountains do not seek forgiveness for the space they take and so,
neither shall I.
```


```
Don't expect anything from anyone, just don't do that.
Live for yourself.
Before you speak, listen.
Before you write, think.
Before you spend, earn.
Before you hate, love.
Before you quit, try.
Before you die, live.
```

```
You're only human.
Forgive yourself!
```

```
Listen to the silence of your heart.
```

```
The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago.
The second best time is now.
```

```
I don't have a choice.
```

```
You are not responsible for the programming you received in childhood.
But as an adult, you are 100% responsible for fixing it.
```

```
Tell me, what is it you plan to do
with your one wild and precious life?
```

```
You ever just see someone's growth
and think "damn that's beautiful."
```

```
The beauty you see in me is a reflection of you.
```

```
Everyone
No matter how well-intentioned and pure of heart
Has a dark side.
```

```
If you want to shine like a sun, first burn like a sun.
```

```
One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light,
but by making the darkness conscious.
```

```
Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will
direct your life and you will call it fate.
```

```
Be picky with who you invest your time in,
wasted time is worse than wasted money.
```

```
If you can't laugh at yourself, you're missing
the best joke of all.
```

```
The aim of argument, or of discussion,
should not be victory, but progress.
```

```
When someone is properly grounded in life,
they shouldn't have to look outside themselves for approval.
```

```
The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
```

```
Go to the people and the places that set a spark in your soul.
```

```
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says "I'm possible".
```

```
Nature wants 5 of your 7 children dead.
It wants you dead by 50.
Everything better than that is brought to you by science & technology.
```

```
The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
```

>  ~~Why is this happening to me?~~ 
>  what is this teaching me?


```
APPLY. FOR. THAT. JOB. EVEN. IF. YOU. DON'T. MEET. ALL. THE. REQUIREMENTS. 100%.
```

```
Monday doesn't suck.
The weather doesn't suck.
Your job doesn't suck. 
Your partner doesn't suck. 
Your negative mindset sucks. 
Your lack of self-worth and self-love sucks. 
Stop complaining about what's missing from your life
and go manifest the fuck out of your dreams.
```

```
Don't accept the work-eat-entertainment-sleep cycle as life.
```

```
When you realize that you love spending time by yourself
because you are a complete and interesting person on your own.
```

```
The search for beauty ended when my eyes met your eyes.
```

```
When I follow my heart, it leads me to you.
```

```
I have crossed oceans of time to find you.
```

```
She is air, I am the fire.
```

```
Be not to shy, to say "yes".
Be not to afraid, to say "no".
```

```
As you wish.
```

```
If you are never alone, you cannot know yourself.
```

```
You make me want to be a better man.
```

```
“Now every time I witness a strong person,
I want to know:
What dark did you conquer in your story?
Mountains do not rise without earthquakes.”
```


```
When I miss you, I re-read our old messages and smile
like an idiot.
```

```
I had so many chances I blew cause I was too damn shy.
```

```
Never mistake motion for action.
```

```
Lol, today you said hi to me and I died.
```

```
Biggest regret of my life - to fight with the ones who loved me.
```

```
I am jealous of every star near you, because I'm not one of them.
```

```
Love not if you fear, fear not if you love.
```

```
I can't seem to calm down
Because I need you here now
No, I can't put my phone down
Hoping that you call now
Scrolling through our pictures
I'm closer to you
```

```
I dial the number but hanged it down.
Being alone for long was making me down.
I close my eyes and ride back to the dark,
where I found you and together we sparked.
```

```
Someday when the pages of my life end, I know that you
will be one of the most beautiful chapters.
```

```
Take her under the moonlight and let her speak her heart out.
```

```
Life is like an ice cream, taste its flavour before it melts away.
```

```
The responsibility of love: to keep another's heart safe.
```

```
When it is all finished, you'll discover it was never random.
```

```
She is rare, so love her right.
```

```
Kiss her and label her as yours.
```

```
You or none.
```

```
Love her too much.
```

```
Future lies in our hands, make it or break it.
```

```
Miracles happen when she's around me.
```

```
I don't want to be friends, I want all of you.
```

```
I smiled, we were under the same sky at least.
```

```
Her heart is a fragile glass, if it breaks
the broken pieces will hurt you too.
```

```
She is a storm worth facing and surviving.
```

```
The one who cares is the one who loves.
```

```
She was looking for someone who could stay by her side
not for the one who goes crazy at her beauty.
```

```
Never give up on love if you feel it's worth waiting.
```

```
Choose the one who choose you before anything and everything.
```

```
Sometimes love dies without warning.
```

```
Express your love, we can't read minds.
```

```
Distance means so little when someone means so much.
```

```
I love people who gossip behind my back. That's exactly
where they belong. Behind my back.
```

```
People are not swings, you can't keep pushing them away
and expecting them to come back.
```

```
It is both a blessing and a curse to feel everything so
very deeply.
```

```
As long as we don't die, this is gonna be one hell of a story.
```

```
I love you, I thought. But I didn't say it.
```

```
Love isn't about perfection, it's about being fearless.
```

```
Even though we never said it to each other, we knew. 
```

```
In love we become little more kind.
```

```
The one you love always looks prettiest of all.
```

```
Look inside to know a person, everything out is just an illusion.
```

```
Beautiful things don't ask for attention.
```

```
I asked God, "Why are you taking me through troubled water?". He
replied, "Because your enemies can't swim."
```

```
There was a time or two that I decided to ask them questions.
I asked what the meaning of all of this was, silently and mentally,
and received my answer, 'It is what you make it.'
```

```
You must find the courage to leave the table
If respect is no longer being served.
```

```
The very essence of romance is uncertainty.
```

```
I stood still, vision blurring, and in that moment,
I heard my heart break. It was a small, clean sound,
like the snapping of a flower's stem.
```


```
Maybe it's the best ending.
```
