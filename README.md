```
Love her too much.
```

```
Future lies in our hands, make it or break it.
```

```
Miracles happen when she's around me.
```

```
Her heart is a fragile glass, if it breaks the broken pieces will hurt you too.
```

```
She is a storm worth facing and surviving.
```

```
The one who cares is the one who loves.
```

```
She was looking for someone who could stay by her side not for the one who goes crazy at her beauty.
