``
Take her under the moonlight and let her speak her heart out.
```

```
Life is like an ice cream, taste its flavour before it melts away.
```

```
The responsibility of love: to keep another's heart safe.
```

```
When it is all finished, you'll discover it was never random.
```

```
She is rare, so love her right.
```

```
Kiss her and label her as yours.
```

```
You or none.
```

```
Love her too much.
```

```
Future lies in our hands, make it or break it.
```

```
Miracles happen when she's around me.
```

```
I don't want to be friends, I want all of you.
```

```
I smiled, we were under the same sky at least.
```

```
Her heart is a fragile glass, if it breaks
the broken pieces will hurt you too.
```

```
She is a storm worth facing and surviving.
```

```
The one who cares is the one who loves.
```

```
She was looking for someone who could stay by her side
not for the one who goes crazy at her beauty.
```

```
Never give up on love if you feel it's worth waiting.
```

```
Choose the one who choose you before anything and everything.
```

```
Sometimes love dies without warning.
```

```
Express your love, we can't read minds.
```

```
Distance means so little when someone means so much.
```

```
I love people who gossip behind my back. That's exactly
where they belong. Behind my back.
```

```
People are not swings, you can't keep pushing them away
and expecting them to come back.
```

```
It is both a blessing and a curse to feel everything so
very deeply.
```

```
As long as we don't die, this is gonna be one hell of a story.
```

```
I love you, I thought. But I didn't say it.
```

```
Love isn't about perfection, it's about being fearless.
```

```
Even though we never said it to each other, we knew. 
```

```
In love we become little more kind.
```

```
The one you love always looks prettiest of all.
```
